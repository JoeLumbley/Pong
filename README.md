### **Set Up Your Environment**

Visual Studio is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) created by Microsoft. 

It is a powerful software development tool that provides a comprehensive set of features and tools for building a wide range of applications.

This is the IDE I use to make "Pong" and I recommend that you use.

Grab Visual Studio Community—it's free and perfect for indie devs.

Install Visual Studio from here:  https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/ and include the .NET Desktop Development workload.
