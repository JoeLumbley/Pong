## Game Loop

The game loop is a critical component of the PüèìNG game, ensuring that the game runs smoothly and updates in real-time. It consists of two main subroutines: **UpdateGame** and **DrawGame**.

### UpdateGame

This subroutine is called at regular intervals to update the game's state. It processes input, updates game objects, checks for collisions, and transitions between game states.

```vb
Private Sub UpdateGame()
    Select Case GameState
        Case GameStateEnum.Playing
            UpdatePlaying()
        Case GameStateEnum.StartScreen
            UpdateStartScreen()
        Case GameStateEnum.Instructions
            UpdateInstructions()
        Case GameStateEnum.Serve
            UpdateServe()
        Case GameStateEnum.Pause
            UpdatePause()
        Case GameStateEnum.EndScreen
            UpdateEndScreen()
    End Select
End Sub
```

### Explanation of UpdateGame
- **Select Case**: This structure evaluates the current game state and calls the corresponding update method.
- Each case corresponds to a different game state, allowing for specific logic to be executed based on the game's current condition.

### DrawGame

This subroutine handles rendering the game's graphics. It draws all the game elements, such as paddles, the ball, and scores, onto the screen.

```vb
Protected Overrides Sub OnPaint(ByVal e As PaintEventArgs)
    DrawGame(e.Graphics) ' Draw all game elements
    UpdateFrameCounter() ' Update frame counter
End Sub
```

### Explanation of DrawGame
- **DrawGame**: Responsible for rendering all visual elements of the game based on the current game state.
- **UpdateFrameCounter**: Keeps track of the frames per second (FPS) for performance monitoring and display.

---

## Update Game Logic

The `UpdateGame` method uses a `Select Case` statement to determine what actions to take based on the current game state. It handles input, updates game objects, and checks for game conditions.

### Example of State Handling

```vb
Private Sub UpdateGame()
    Select Case GameState
        Case GameStateEnum.Playing
            UpdatePlaying()
            ' Additional cases for other states...
    End Select
End Sub
```

### State-Specific Logic
Each state has a corresponding method that encapsulates its specific logic:
- **UpdatePlaying**: Handles game logic while playing, including movement, collision detection, and scoring.
- **UpdateStartScreen**: Manages the start screen logic, including user input for starting the game.
- **UpdateInstructions**: Displays and manages the instructions screen, guiding players on how to play.
- **UpdateServe**: Prepares the game for serving, positioning the ball and paddles appropriately.
- **UpdatePause**: Manages the pause state, allowing players to resume the game.
- **UpdateEndScreen**: Displays the end screen logic, showing the winner and allowing for a reset.

## Input Handling

### Keyboard Input for Left Paddle

The game allows players to control the paddles using keyboard input. Here's how the left paddle's movement is handled:

```vb
Private Sub UpdateLeftPaddleKeyboard()
    If WKeyDown Then
        MoveLeftPaddleUp()
    ElseIf SKeyDown Then
        MoveLeftPaddleDown()
    Else
        If Not Controllers.Connected(0) Then
            DecelerateLeftPaddle()
            If ApplyLeftPaddleEnglish Then
                ApplyLeftPaddleEnglish = False
                Ball.Velocity.X = ServSpeed
                Ball.Velocity.Y = 0
            End If
        End If
    End If
End Sub
```

### Explanation of Keyboard Input
- **WKeyDown**: Checks if the W key is pressed to move the left paddle up.
- **SKeyDown**: Checks if the S key is pressed to move the left paddle down.
- **DecelerateLeftPaddle**: If neither key is pressed and the controller is not connected, the paddle decelerates to a stop.

### Controller Input Handling

The game also supports Xbox controllers. The input handling function uses the `XboxControllers` structure to manage the state of the controllers.

### Example of Controller Input Logic

```vb
Private Sub HandleControllerInput()
    For ControllerNumber As Integer = 0 To 3
        If Controllers.Connected(ControllerNumber) Then
            DoButtonLogic(ControllerNumber)
            UpdateLeftThumbstickPosition(ControllerNumber)
            UpdateRightThumbstickPosition(ControllerNumber)
        End If
    Next
End Sub
```

- **DoButtonLogic**: Processes button presses for the specified controller.
- **UpdateLeftThumbstickPosition**: Updates the position of the left thumbstick based on input.
- **UpdateRightThumbstickPosition**: Updates the position of the right thumbstick based on input.

---

## Collision Detection

### Check for Paddle Hits

Collision detection is essential for determining interactions between game objects. Here's how the game checks for collisions with the paddles:

```vb
Private Sub CheckForLeftPaddleHits()
    If Ball.Rect.IntersectsWith(LeftPaddle.Rect) Then
        PlaySound("hit")
        Ball.Velocity.X = 0
        Ball.Velocity.Y = 0
        Ball.Rect.X = LeftPaddle.Rect.X + LeftPaddle.Rect.Width + 5
        Ball.Position.X = Ball.Rect.X
        ApplyLeftPaddleEnglish = True
        Controllers.VibrateLeft(0, 42000)
    End If
End Sub
```

### Explanation of Collision Detection
- **IntersectsWith**: Checks if the ball's rectangle intersects with the left paddle's rectangle, indicating a collision.
- **PlaySound**: Plays a sound effect when the ball hits the paddle.
- **Velocity**: Stops the ball's movement and sets its position to avoid overlapping with the paddle.
- **ApplyLeftPaddleEnglish**: A flag indicating that spin should be applied to the ball after hitting the paddle.
- **Vibration Feedback**: Triggers a vibration effect on the controller for tactile feedback.

### Check for Right Paddle Hits

```vb
Private Sub CheckForRightPaddleHits()
    If Ball.Rect.IntersectsWith(RightPaddle.Rect) Then
        PlaySound("hit")
        Ball.Velocity.X = 0
        Ball.Velocity.Y = 0
        Ball.Rect.X = RightPaddle.Rect.X - (Ball.Rect.Width + 5)
        Ball.Position.X = Ball.Rect.X
        If NumberOfPlayers = 2 Then
            ApplyRightPaddleEnglish = True
            Controllers.VibrateLeft(1, 42000)
        Else
            DoComputerPlayerEnglish()
        End If
    End If
End Sub
```

This method checks if the ball intersects with the right paddle and handles the logic for bouncing the ball back and updating its velocity.

---

## Game State Transitions

### Check for End Game

```vb
Private Sub CheckforEndGame()
    If LeftPaddleScore >= 10 Then
        Winner = WinStateEnum.LeftPaddle
        GameState = GameStateEnum.EndScreen
        PlayWinningSound()
    End If

    If RightPaddleScore >= 10 Then
        Winner = WinStateEnum.RightPaddle
        GameState = GameStateEnum.EndScreen
        PlayWinningSound()
    End If
End Sub
```

This method checks if a player has reached the winning score and transitions the game state to the end screen if so:
- **Winner**: Sets the winner based on the score.
- **PlayWinningSound**: Plays a sound to indicate the end of the game.

---

## Rendering Graphics

### OnPaint Method

```vb
Protected Overrides Sub OnPaint(ByVal e As PaintEventArgs)
    MyBase.OnPaint(e)
    DrawGame(e.Graphics)
    UpdateFrameCounter()
End Sub
```

This method is responsible for rendering the game graphics. It calls the `DrawGame` method to draw all game elements and then updates the frame counter.

### DrawGame Method

```vb
Private Sub DrawGame(g As Graphics)
    g.Clear(Color.Black) ' Clear the background
    Select Case GameState
        Case GameStateEnum.Playing
            DrawPlaying(g)
        Case GameStateEnum.StartScreen
            DrawStartScreen(g)
        Case GameStateEnum.Instructions
            DrawInstructions(g)
        Case GameStateEnum.Serve
            DrawServe(g)
        Case GameStateEnum.Pause
            DrawPauseScreen(g)
        Case GameStateEnum.EndScreen
            DrawEndScreen(g)
    End Select
End Sub
```

- **g.Clear(Color.Black)**: Clears the previous frame by filling the background with black.
- **Select Case**: Determines which drawing method to call based on the current game state.

### Drawing Methods

Each state has its own drawing logic:
- **DrawPlaying**: Renders the game elements during active gameplay, including paddles, ball, and scores.
- **DrawStartScreen**: Displays the start screen with options for players to choose.
- **DrawInstructions**: Shows the instructions for playing the game, guiding players on controls and objectives.
- **DrawServe**: Prepares the visual elements for the serving state, indicating which player is serving.
- **DrawPauseScreen**: Displays the pause screen with relevant information and options to resume or exit.
- **DrawEndScreen**: Shows the end screen with the winner and final scores, along with options to restart the game.

### Example of DrawPlaying Method

```vb
Private Sub DrawPlaying(g As Graphics)
    g.Clear(Color.Black)
    DrawLeftPaddle(g)
    DrawRightPaddle(g)
    DrawBall(g)
    DrawScore(g)
    DrawFPSDisplay(g)
End Sub
```

In the `DrawPlaying` method, we clear the background, draw the paddles, ball, and scores, and display the current frames per second (FPS). This method is called repeatedly during the game loop to ensure a smooth visual experience.

## Sound Management

### Adding and Playing Sounds

```vb
Private Function AddSound(SoundName As String, FilePath As String) As Boolean
    If Not String.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(SoundName) AndAlso IO.File.Exists(FilePath) Then
        Dim CommandOpen As String = $"open ""{FilePath}"" alias {SoundName}"
        Dim ReturnString As New StringBuilder(128)
        If mciSendStringW(CommandOpen, ReturnString, 0, IntPtr.Zero) = 0 Then
            Array.Resize(Sounds, Sounds.Length + 1)
            Sounds(Sounds.Length - 1) = SoundName
            Return True
        End If
    End If
    Return False
End Function
```

### Explanation of Sound Management

- **CommandOpen**: Constructs a command to open the sound file.
- **mciSendStringW**: Sends the command to the multimedia API to open the sound file.

### Playing Sounds

```vb
Private Function PlaySound(SoundName As String) As Boolean
    If Sounds IsNot Nothing AndAlso Sounds.Contains(SoundName) Then
        Dim CommandSeekToStart As String = $"seek {SoundName} to start"
        Dim ReturnString As New StringBuilder(128)
        mciSendStringW(CommandSeekToStart, ReturnString, 0, IntPtr.Zero)
        Dim CommandPlay As String = $"play {SoundName} notify"
        If mciSendStringW(CommandPlay, ReturnString, 0, Me.Handle) = 0 Then
            Return True
        End If
    End If
    Return False
End Function
```

This function plays specific sounds at appropriate game events (e.g., ball hits, scoring). It ensures that audio feedback is provided to enhance the gaming experience.
