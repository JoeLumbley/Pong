[Imports and Class Declaration](#%EF%B8%8F-keyboard-controls) 
[Enumerations](#-xbox-controllers) 
[Game Object Structure](#-code-walk-through) 
[Top](#png)

---

##  **Imports and Class Declaration**
```vb
Imports System.Threading
Imports System.Numerics
Imports System.ComponentModel
Imports System.Runtime.InteropServices
Imports System.Text
Imports System.IO

Public Class Form1
```
- The code begins by importing necessary namespaces for threading, mathematical operations (like vectors), interop services for using unmanaged code, and file handling.
- The class `Form1` is declared, which will contain all the game logic.

##  **Enumerations**
```vb
Private Enum GameStateEnum
    StartScreen
    Instructions
    Serve
    Playing
    EndScreen
    Pause
End Enum
```
- `GameStateEnum` defines different states of the game (e.g., Start Screen, Playing, End Screen).

##  **Game Object Structure**
```vb
Private Structure GameObject
    Public Position As Vector2
    Public Acceleration As Vector2
    Public Velocity As Vector2
    Public MaxVelocity As Vector2
    Public Rect As Rectangle
End Structure
```
- `GameObject` structure is defined to represent game entities like the ball and paddles. It includes properties for position, acceleration, velocity, maximum velocity, and the rectangle that represents its dimensions.

##  **Game State Variables**
```vb
Private GameState As GameStateEnum = GameStateEnum.StartScreen
Private Serving As ServeStateEnum = ServeStateEnum.LeftPaddle
Private ServSpeed As Single = 500
Private Winner As WinStateEnum = WinStateEnum.LeftPaddle
Private NumberOfPlayers As Integer = 2
```
- These variables track the current game state, which paddle is serving, the speed of the serve, the winner, and the number of players.

##  **Game Loop**
```vb
Private Sub Timer1_Tick(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles Timer1.Tick

    UpdateGame()

    Refresh()

End Sub
```
- This subroutine is called at regular intervals (set by a timer). It updates the game state and refreshes the display.

##  **Update Game Logic**
```vb
    Private Sub UpdateGame()

        Select Case GameState

            Case GameStateEnum.Playing

                UpdatePlaying()

            Case GameStateEnum.StartScreen

                UpdateStartScreen()

            Case GameStateEnum.Instructions

                UpdateInstructions()

            Case GameStateEnum.Serve

                UpdateServe()

            Case GameStateEnum.Pause

                UpdatePause()

            Case GameStateEnum.EndScreen

                UpdateEndScreen()

        End Select

    End Sub

```
- The `UpdateGame` method uses a `Select Case` statement to determine what actions to take based on the current game state. It handles input, updates game objects, and checks for game conditions.

##  **Input Handling**
```vb
    Private Sub UpdateLeftPaddleKeyboard()

        If WKeyDown Then

            MoveLeftPaddleUp()

        ElseIf SKeyDown Then

            MoveLeftPaddleDown()

        Else

            If Not Connected(0) Then

                DecelerateLeftPaddle()

                If ApplyLeftPaddleEnglish Then

                    ApplyLeftPaddleEnglish = False

                    'Send ball to the right.
                    Ball.Velocity.X = ServSpeed
                    Ball.Velocity.Y = 0

                End If

            End If

        End If

    End Sub
```
- This method checks if specific keys are pressed (W/S for the left paddle) and moves the paddle accordingly.

##  **Collision Detection**
```vb
    Private Sub CheckForPaddleHits()

        If Ball.Rect.IntersectsWith(LeftPaddle.Rect) Then

            PlaySound("hit")

            Ball.Velocity.X = 0
            Ball.Velocity.Y = 0

            'Push the ball to the paddles right edge.
            Ball.Rect.X = LeftPaddle.Rect.X + LeftPaddle.Rect.Width + 5

            Ball.Position.X = Ball.Rect.X

            ApplyLeftPaddleEnglish = True

            VibrateLeft(0, 42000)

        End If

        If Ball.Rect.IntersectsWith(RightPaddle.Rect) Then

            PlaySound("hit")

            Ball.Velocity.X = 0
            Ball.Velocity.Y = 0

            Ball.Rect.X = RightPaddle.Rect.X - (Ball.Rect.Width + 5)

            Ball.Position.X = Ball.Rect.X

            If NumberOfPlayers = 2 Then

                ApplyRightPaddleEnglish = True

                VibrateLeft(1, 42000)

            Else
                'For the computer player random english.
                'This makes the game more interesting.

                Select Case RandomNumber()

                    Case 1
                        'Send ball up and to the left.

                        Ball.Velocity.X = -ServSpeed
                        Ball.Velocity.Y = -ServSpeed

                    Case 2
                        'Send ball to the left.

                        Ball.Velocity.X = -ServSpeed
                        Ball.Velocity.Y = 0

                    Case 3
                        'Send ball down and to the left.

                        Ball.Velocity.X = -ServSpeed
                        Ball.Velocity.Y = ServSpeed

                End Select

            End If

        End If

    End Sub

```
- This method checks if the ball intersects with either paddle, handling the logic for bouncing the ball back and updating its velocity.



### Code Breakdown

 **```Private Sub CheckForPaddleHits()```**: This line starts a new method called ```CheckForPaddleHits```. "Private" means this method can only be used within the same class. "Sub" indicates that this method does not return a value.

 **```If Ball.Rect.IntersectsWith(LeftPaddle.Rect) Then```**: This line checks if the ball's rectangle (its position and size) overlaps with the left paddle's rectangle. If they do intersect, the code inside the ```If``` block will run.

 **```PlaySound("hit")```**: This line plays a sound effect called "hit". It provides audio feedback when the ball hits the paddle.


 **```Ball.Velocity.X = 0```** and **```Ball.Velocity.Y = 0```**: These lines stop the ball's movement by setting its horizontal (X) and vertical (Y) speeds to zero.


 **```Ball.Rect.X = LeftPaddle.Rect.X + LeftPaddle.Rect.Width + 5```**: This sets the ball's position to the right edge of the left paddle, plus an extra 5 pixels to create some space.


 **```Ball.Position.X = Ball.Rect.X```**: This updates the ball's position to match the new rectangle position. It ensures that the ball's visual representation is in the correct spot.


 **```ApplyLeftPaddleEnglish = True```**: This line sets a flag to indicate that the ball should have some spin (English) applied when it moves after hitting the left paddle.


 **```VibrateLeft(0, 42000)```**: This command triggers a vibration effect on the left controller to enhance the player‚Äôs experience.


 **```End If```**: This marks the end of the first ```If``` statement.


 **```If Ball.Rect.IntersectsWith(RightPaddle.Rect) Then```**: This checks if the ball intersects with the right paddle. If it does, the following code will execute.


 **```PlaySound("hit")```**: Similar to before, this plays the "hit" sound effect when the ball hits the right paddle.


 **```Ball.Velocity.X = 0```** and **```Ball.Velocity.Y = 0```**: Again, this stops the ball's movement.


 **```Ball.Rect.X = RightPaddle.Rect.X - (Ball.Rect.Width + 5)```**: This moves the ball to the left of the right paddle, ensuring there‚Äôs a 5-pixel gap.


 **```Ball.Position.X = Ball.Rect.X```**: This updates the ball's position to match the new rectangle position.


 **```If NumberOfPlayers = 2 Then```**: This checks if there are two players in the game. If so, the following code will execute.


 **```ApplyRightPaddleEnglish = True```**: This sets a flag to apply spin (English) to the ball after it hits the right paddle.


 **```VibrateLeft(1, 42000)```**: This vibrates the right controller to provide feedback.


 **```Else```**: This indicates that if there are not two players, the following code will run instead.


 **```Select Case RandomNumber()```**: This starts a selection process based on a random number generated by the ```RandomNumber()``` function.

```vb
                Case 1
                    Ball.Velocity.X = -ServSpeed
                    Ball.Velocity.Y = -ServSpeed
```
 **```Case 1```**: If the random number is 1, the ball will move up and to the left by setting its X and Y velocities to negative values (indicating left and upward movement).

```vb
                Case 2
                    Ball.Velocity.X = -ServSpeed
                    Ball.Velocity.Y = 0
```
 **```Case 2```**: If the random number is 2, the ball will move directly to the left (negative X velocity) without any vertical movement (Y velocity is zero).

```vb
                Case 3
                    Ball.Velocity.X = -ServSpeed
                    Ball.Velocity.Y = ServSpeed
```
 **```Case 3```**: If the random number is 3, the ball will move down and to the left (negative X velocity and positive Y velocity).


 **```End Select```**: This marks the end of the selection process.


 **```End If```**: This marks the end of the second ```If``` statement.


 **```End If```**: This marks the end of the first ```If``` statement checking for the right paddle.

 **```End Sub```**: This marks the end of the ```CheckForPaddleHits``` method.


This method checks if the ball hits either paddle and handles the interaction by stopping the ball, moving it to the correct position, playing a sound, and applying spin or random movement based on the game conditions. It enhances the gameplay experience by providing feedback through sound and vibration.




##  **Game State Transitions**
```vb
Private Sub CheckforEndGame()
    If LeftPaddleScore >= 10 Then
        Winner = WinStateEnum.LeftPaddle
        GameState = GameStateEnum.EndScreen
    End If
    ...
End Sub
```
- This method checks if a player has reached the winning score and transitions the game state to the end screen if so.

##  **Rendering Graphics**
```vb
    Protected Overrides Sub OnPaint(ByVal e As PaintEventArgs)

        DrawGame()

        'Show buffer on form.
        Buffer.Render(e.Graphics)

        'Release memory used by buffer.
        Buffer.Dispose()
        Buffer = Nothing

        'Create new buffer.
        Buffer = Context.Allocate(CreateGraphics(), ClientRectangle)

        UpdateFrameCounter()

    End Sub

```
- This method is responsible for rendering the game graphics. It calls the `DrawGame` method to draw all game elements and then renders the buffer to the screen.



```Protected Overrides Sub OnPaint(ByVal e As PaintEventArgs)```: This line starts the ```OnPaint``` method, which is responsible for painting the game's graphics. ```Overrides``` means it replaces the base class's ```OnPaint``` method. ```e``` is a PaintEventArgs object that gives you access to the graphics object.

```DrawGame()```: This line calls a method named ```DrawGame```. This method contains the logic for drawing all the game elements like paddles, balls, and scores.

```Buffer.Render(e.Graphics)```: This line tells the game to display the image from a buffer (a temporary storage) onto the screen using ```e.Graphics```.

```Buffer.Dispose()```: This line frees up memory used by the buffer. It's a cleanup step to ensure your program doesn‚Äôt use more memory than it needs.

```Buffer = Nothing```: This line sets the buffer to ```Nothing``` (null), ensuring it‚Äôs completely reset and no longer in use.

```Buffer = Context.Allocate(CreateGraphics(), ClientRectangle)```: This line creates a new buffer. ```Context.Allocate``` sets up the buffer to match the size of the game's window (```ClientRectangle```).

```UpdateFrameCounter()```: This line updates a counter that keeps track of how many frames have been displayed. It's useful for performance monitoring or displaying the frame rate.






##  **Sound Management**

```vb
Private Function AddSound(SoundName As String, FilePath As String) As Boolean

    If Not String.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(SoundName) AndAlso IO.File.Exists(FilePath) Then

        Dim CommandOpen As String = $"open ""{FilePath}"" alias {SoundName}"

        Dim ReturnString As New StringBuilder(128)

        If mciSendStringW(CommandOpen, ReturnString, 0, IntPtr.Zero) = 0 Then

            Array.Resize(Sounds, Sounds.Length + 1)

            Sounds(Sounds.Length - 1) = SoundName

            Return True

        End If

    End If

    Return False

End Function

```

- **Loading Sounds**: The game loads sound files from specified paths and associates them with names for easy reference.

```Private Function AddSound(SoundName As String, FilePath As String) As Boolean```: This line defines a function named ```AddSound```. It takes two parameters: ```SoundName``` and ```FilePath```. The function returns a Boolean value (```True``` or ```False```).

```If Not String.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(SoundName) AndAlso IO.File.Exists(FilePath) Then```: This line checks if ```SoundName``` is not empty and if the file at ```FilePath``` exists.

```Dim CommandOpen As String = $"open ""{FilePath}"" alias {SoundName}"```: This line creates a command string to open the sound file with a specific alias name.

```Dim ReturnString As New StringBuilder(128)```: This line creates a new StringBuilder object with a capacity of 128 characters to store the response from the command.

```If mciSendStringW(CommandOpen, ReturnString, 0, IntPtr.Zero) = 0 Then```: This line sends the command to open the sound file. If the command is successful (returns 0), it proceeds to the next steps.

```Array.Resize(Sounds, Sounds.Length + 1)```: This line resizes the ```Sounds``` array to accommodate one more element.

```Sounds(Sounds.Length - 1) = SoundName```: This line adds the ```SoundName``` to the last position of the ```Sounds``` array.

```Return True```: This line returns ```True```, indicating that the sound was successfully added.

```End If```: This line marks the end of the ```If``` block.

```Return False```: This line returns ```False``` if the sound could not be added.

```End Function```: This line marks the end of the function.

This function checks if the sound file exists, opens it, and adds it to an array of sounds for your game. If any step fails, it returns ```False```. 



- **Volume Control**: The volume of sounds can be adjusted, allowing for a customizable audio experience.
- **Looping Sounds**: Background music can be looped to create an immersive atmosphere.



```vb
Private Function PlaySound(SoundName As String) As Boolean

    If Sounds IsNot Nothing AndAlso Sounds.Contains(SoundName) Then

        Dim CommandSeekToStart As String = $"seek {SoundName} to start"

        Dim ReturnString As New StringBuilder(128)

        mciSendStringW(CommandSeekToStart, ReturnString, 0, IntPtr.Zero)

        Dim CommandPlay As String = $"play {SoundName} notify"

        If mciSendStringW(CommandPlay, ReturnString, 0, Me.Handle) = 0 Then

            Return True

        End If

    End If

    Return False

End Function
```
- **Playing Sounds**: Functions are provided to play specific sounds at appropriate game events (e.g., ball hits, scoring).


- This function manages sound effects, allowing sounds to be added and played during the game.
