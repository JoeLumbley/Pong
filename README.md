##  **Game Loop**
```vb
Private Sub Timer1_Tick(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles Timer1.Tick

    UpdateGame()

    Refresh()

End Sub
```
- This subroutine is called at regular intervals (set by a timer). It updates the game state and refreshes the display.

### Code Breakdown

`Private Sub Timer1_Tick(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles Timer1.Tick`: This subroutine is executed at regular intervals, controlled by a timer named `Timer1`. The `Tick` event is triggered by the timer at specified intervals. `sender` is the source of the event, and `e` is the event data.

`UpdateGame()`: This line calls the `UpdateGame` method, which contains the logic for updating the game's state. This might include moving paddles, updating scores, checking for collisions, etc.

`Refresh()`: This line refreshes the display, causing the form to redraw its contents. It ensures that any changes made by `UpdateGame` are visually updated on the screen.


This subroutine keeps the game running smoothly by continuously updating the game state and refreshing the display at regular intervals. Essentially, it's the heartbeat of your game loop.

##  **Update Game Logic**
```vb
    Private Sub UpdateGame()

        Select Case GameState

            Case GameStateEnum.Playing

                UpdatePlaying()

            Case GameStateEnum.StartScreen

                UpdateStartScreen()

            Case GameStateEnum.Instructions

                UpdateInstructions()

            Case GameStateEnum.Serve

                UpdateServe()

            Case GameStateEnum.Pause

                UpdatePause()

            Case GameStateEnum.EndScreen

                UpdateEndScreen()

        End Select

    End Sub

```
- The `UpdateGame` method uses a `Select Case` statement to determine what actions to take based on the current game state. It handles input, updates game objects, and checks for game conditions.

##  **Input Handling**
```vb
    Private Sub UpdateLeftPaddleKeyboard()

        If WKeyDown Then

            MoveLeftPaddleUp()

        ElseIf SKeyDown Then

            MoveLeftPaddleDown()

        Else

            If Not Connected(0) Then

                DecelerateLeftPaddle()

                If ApplyLeftPaddleEnglish Then

                    ApplyLeftPaddleEnglish = False

                    'Send ball to the right.
                    Ball.Velocity.X = ServSpeed
                    Ball.Velocity.Y = 0

                End If

            End If

        End If

    End Sub
```
- This method checks if specific keys are pressed (W/S for the left paddle) and moves the paddle accordingly.
  
### Code Breakdown


```Private Sub UpdateLeftPaddleKeyboard()```: This line defines a private subroutine named ```UpdateLeftPaddleKeyboard```. It's responsible for updating the movement of the left paddle based on keyboard input.

```If WKeyDown Then```: Checks if the ```W``` key is pressed. If true, it calls ```MoveLeftPaddleUp()``` to move the left paddle up.

```ElseIf SKeyDown Then```: If the ```W``` key is not pressed, it checks if the ```S``` key is pressed. If true, it calls ```MoveLeftPaddleDown()``` to move the left paddle down.

```Else```: If neither the ```W``` key nor the ```S``` key is pressed, it goes into this block.

```If Not Connected(0) Then```: Checks if the first controller is not connected. If true, it proceeds with the following steps.

```DecelerateLeftPaddle()```: Calls a function to slow down the left paddle.

```If ApplyLeftPaddleEnglish Then```: Checks if the flag to apply spin (English) to the ball is set. If true, it proceeds with the following steps.

```ApplyLeftPaddleEnglish = False```: Resets the flag for applying spin.

```Ball.Velocity.X = ServSpeed```: Sets the ball's horizontal velocity to a serving speed.

```Ball.Velocity.Y = 0```: Sets the ball's vertical velocity to 0, ensuring it moves straight.

This subroutine effectively manages the left paddle‚Äôs movement based on keyboard input, including handling cases where the controller isn't connected.

##  **Collision Detection**
```vb
 Private Sub CheckForLeftPaddleHits()

     ' Did the ball hit the left paddle?
     If Ball.Rect.IntersectsWith(LeftPaddle.Rect) Then
         ' Yes, the ball did hit the left paddle.

         PlaySound("hit")

         ' Stop the ball's movement.
         Ball.Velocity.X = 0
         Ball.Velocity.Y = 0

         ' Set the ball's position to the right edge of the left paddle, plus an extra 5 pixels.
         Ball.Rect.X = LeftPaddle.Rect.X + LeftPaddle.Rect.Width + 5

         ' Update the ball's position to match the new rectangle position.
         Ball.Position.X = Ball.Rect.X

         ' Set a flag to indicate that the ball should have some spin (English) applied.
         ApplyLeftPaddleEnglish = True

         ' Trigger a vibration effect on the left side of the left paddle controller "0".
         VibrateLeft(0, 42000)

     End If

 End Sub
```
- This method checks if the ball intersects with the left paddle, handling the logic for bouncing the ball back and updating its velocity.

### Code Breakdown

```Private Sub CheckForLeftPaddleHits()```: This line starts a subroutine called CheckForLeftPaddleHits. It's a private subroutine, so it's only accessible within the current module or class.

```If Ball.Rect.IntersectsWith(LeftPaddle.Rect) Then```: This line checks if the ball's rectangle intersects with the left paddle's rectangle. Essentially, it checks if the ball has hit the left paddle.

```PlaySound("hit")```: If the ball hits the left paddle, this line plays a sound named "hit" to provide audio feedback.

```Ball.Velocity.X = 0``` and ```Ball.Velocity.Y = 0```: These lines stop the ball's movement by setting its horizontal and vertical velocity to 0.

```Ball.Rect.X = LeftPaddle.Rect.X + LeftPaddle.Rect.Width + 5```: This line sets the ball's position to the right edge of the left paddle, plus an additional 5 pixels, to ensure the ball doesn't overlap the paddle.

```Ball.Position.X = Ball.Rect.X```: This line updates the ball's position to match the new rectangle position, keeping everything in sync.

```ApplyLeftPaddleEnglish = True```: This line sets a flag indicating that the ball should have some spin (English) applied, possibly affecting its movement after hitting the paddle.

```VibrateLeft(0, 42000)```: This line triggers a vibration effect on the left side of the left paddle controller, adding a tactile response to the hit.

All these steps together create a comprehensive check for collisions between the ball and the left paddle and apply appropriate responses like stopping the ball, playing sounds, and updating positions. 

 
---

```vb
     Private Sub CheckForRightPaddleHits()

        ' Did the ball hit the right paddle?
        If Ball.Rect.IntersectsWith(RightPaddle.Rect) Then
            ' Yes, the ball did hit the right paddle.

            PlaySound("hit")

            ' Stop the ball's movement.
            Ball.Velocity.X = 0
            Ball.Velocity.Y = 0

            ' Moves the ball to the left of the right paddle, ensuring there‚Äôs a 5-pixel gap.
            Ball.Rect.X = RightPaddle.Rect.X - (Ball.Rect.Width + 5)

            ' Update the ball's position to match the new rectangle position.
            Ball.Position.X = Ball.Rect.X

            ' Is the number of players two?
            If NumberOfPlayers = 2 Then
                ' Yes, the number of players is two.

                ' Set a flag to indicate that the ball should have some spin (English) applied.
                ApplyRightPaddleEnglish = True

                ' Trigger a vibration effect on the left side of the right paddle controller "1".
                VibrateLeft(1, 42000)

            Else
                ' No, the number of players is not two.

                DoComputerPlayerEnglish()

            End If

        End If

    End Sub
```
- This method checks if the ball intersects with the right paddle, handling the logic for bouncing the ball back and updating its velocity.

### Code Breakdown

```Private Sub CheckForRightPaddleHits()```: Starts a subroutine to check if the ball hits the right paddle.

```If Ball.Rect.IntersectsWith(RightPaddle.Rect) Then```: Checks if the ball‚Äôs rectangle intersects with the right paddle‚Äôs rectangle.

```PlaySound("hit")```: Plays the sound named "hit" when the ball hits the paddle.

```Ball.Velocity.X = 0``` and ```Ball.Velocity.Y = 0```: Stops the ball's movement by setting its horizontal and vertical velocity to 0.

```Ball.Rect.X = RightPaddle.Rect.X - (Ball.Rect.Width + 5)```: Moves the ball to the left of the right paddle, leaving a 5-pixel gap.

```Ball.Position.X = Ball.Rect.X```: Updates the ball‚Äôs position to match the new rectangle position.

```If NumberOfPlayers = 2 Then```: Checks if there are two players.

```ApplyRightPaddleEnglish = True```: Sets a flag to apply spin (English) to the ball.

##  **Game State Transitions**
```vb
    Private Sub CheckforEndGame()

        ' Did left paddle reach winning score?
        If LeftPaddleScore >= 10 Then
            ' Yes, left paddle did reach winning score.

            ' Set winner to left paddle.
            Winner = WinStateEnum.LeftPaddle

            ' Reset the frame counter.
            FlashCount = 0

            ' Change game state to end screen.
            GameState = GameStateEnum.EndScreen

            PlayWinningSound()

        End If

        ' Did right paddle reach winning score?
        If RightPaddleScore >= 10 Then
            ' Yes, right paddle did reach winning score.

            ' Set winner to right paddle.
            Winner = WinStateEnum.RightPaddle

            ' Reset frame counter.
            FlashCount = 0

            ' Change game state to end screen.
            GameState = GameStateEnum.EndScreen

            PlayWinningSound()

        End If

    End Sub

```
- This method checks if a player has reached the winning score and transitions the game state to the end screen if so.

### Code Breakdown


`Private Sub CheckforEndGame()`: This defines a private subroutine named `CheckforEndGame`. It‚Äôs responsible for checking if any player has reached the winning score.

`If LeftPaddleScore >= 10 Then`: Checks if the left paddle‚Äôs score is 10 or more.

`Winner = WinStateEnum.LeftPaddle`: If the left paddle has reached the winning score, it sets the winner to the left paddle.

`FlashCount = 0`: Resets the frame counter, for the end game animation.

`GameState = GameStateEnum.EndScreen`: Changes the game state to the end screen, where the end game events are handled.

`PlayWinningSound()`: Plays a sound to celebrate the win.

`If RightPaddleScore >= 10 Then`: Similarly checks if the right paddle has reached the winning score.

`Winner = WinStateEnum.RightPaddle`: Sets the winner to the right paddle if it has reached the winning score.

`FlashCount = 0`: Resets the frame counter again.

`GameState = GameStateEnum.EndScreen`: Changes the game state to the end screen.

`PlayWinningSound()`: Plays the winning sound.

This method ensures the game transitions smoothly to the end screen when either player reaches the winning score.

##  **Rendering Graphics**
```vb
    Protected Overrides Sub OnPaint(ByVal e As PaintEventArgs)

        DrawGame()

        'Show buffer on form.
        Buffer.Render(e.Graphics)

        'Release memory used by buffer.
        Buffer.Dispose()
        Buffer = Nothing

        'Create new buffer.
        Buffer = Context.Allocate(CreateGraphics(), ClientRectangle)

        UpdateFrameCounter()

    End Sub

```
- This method is responsible for rendering the game graphics. It calls the `DrawGame` method to draw all game elements and then renders the buffer to the screen.

### Code Breakdown


`Protected Overrides Sub OnPaint(ByVal e As PaintEventArgs)`: This line starts the `OnPaint` method, which is responsible for painting the game's graphics. `Overrides` means it replaces the base class's `OnPaint` method. `e` is a PaintEventArgs object that gives you access to the graphics object.

`DrawGame()`: This line calls a method named `DrawGame`. This method contains the logic for drawing all the game elements like paddles, balls, and scores.

`Buffer.Render(e.Graphics)`: This line tells the game to display the image from a buffer (a temporary storage) onto the screen using `e.Graphics`.

`Buffer.Dispose()`: This line frees up memory used by the buffer. It's a cleanup step to ensure your program doesn‚Äôt use more memory than it needs.

`Buffer = Nothing`: This line sets the buffer to `Nothing` (null), ensuring it‚Äôs completely reset and no longer in use.

`Buffer = Context.Allocate(CreateGraphics(), ClientRectangle)`: This line creates a new buffer. `Context.Allocate` sets up the buffer to match the size of the game's window (`ClientRectangle`).

`UpdateFrameCounter()`: This line updates a counter that keeps track of how many frames have been displayed. It's useful for performance monitoring or displaying the frame rate.

##  **Sound Management**

```vb
Private Function AddSound(SoundName As String, FilePath As String) As Boolean

    If Not String.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(SoundName) AndAlso IO.File.Exists(FilePath) Then

        Dim CommandOpen As String = $"open ""{FilePath}"" alias {SoundName}"

        Dim ReturnString As New StringBuilder(128)

        If mciSendStringW(CommandOpen, ReturnString, 0, IntPtr.Zero) = 0 Then

            Array.Resize(Sounds, Sounds.Length + 1)

            Sounds(Sounds.Length - 1) = SoundName

            Return True

        End If

    End If

    Return False

End Function

```

- **Loading Sounds**: The game loads sound files from specified paths and associates them with names for easy reference.

### Code Breakdown


`Private Function AddSound(SoundName As String, FilePath As String) As Boolean`: This line defines a function named `AddSound`. It takes two parameters: `SoundName` and `FilePath`. The function returns a Boolean value (`True` or `False`).

`If Not String.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(SoundName) AndAlso IO.File.Exists(FilePath) Then`: This line checks if `SoundName` is not empty and if the file at `FilePath` exists.

`Dim CommandOpen As String = $"open ""{FilePath}"" alias {SoundName}"`: This line creates a command string to open the sound file with a specific alias name.

`Dim ReturnString As New StringBuilder(128)`: This line creates a new StringBuilder object with a capacity of 128 characters to store the response from the command.

`If mciSendStringW(CommandOpen, ReturnString, 0, IntPtr.Zero) = 0 Then`: This line sends the command to open the sound file. If the command is successful (returns 0), it proceeds to the next steps.

`Array.Resize(Sounds, Sounds.Length + 1)`: This line resizes the `Sounds` array to accommodate one more element.

`Sounds(Sounds.Length - 1) = SoundName`: This line adds the `SoundName` to the last position of the `Sounds` array.

`Return True`: This line returns `True`, indicating that the sound was successfully added.

`End If`: This line marks the end of the `If` block.

`Return False`: This line returns `False` if the sound could not be added.

`End Function`: This line marks the end of the function.

This function checks if the sound file exists, opens it, and adds it to an array of sounds for your game. If any step fails, it returns `False`. 


---




```vb
Private Function PlaySound(SoundName As String) As Boolean

    If Sounds IsNot Nothing AndAlso Sounds.Contains(SoundName) Then

        Dim CommandSeekToStart As String = $"seek {SoundName} to start"

        Dim ReturnString As New StringBuilder(128)

        mciSendStringW(CommandSeekToStart, ReturnString, 0, IntPtr.Zero)

        Dim CommandPlay As String = $"play {SoundName} notify"

        If mciSendStringW(CommandPlay, ReturnString, 0, Me.Handle) = 0 Then

            Return True

        End If

    End If

    Return False

End Function
```
- **Playing Sounds**: This function is provided to play specific sounds at appropriate game events (e.g., ball hits, scoring).


- **Volume Control**: The volume of sounds can be adjusted, allowing for a customizable audio experience.
- **Looping Sounds**: Background music can be looped to create an immersive atmosphere.
