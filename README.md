# Pong
In this app we remake the classic ping pong game.
This version is resizable, pausable and has a computer player.
Supports keyboard, mouse and Xbox controllers including the vibration effect (rumble).
It was written in VB.NET in 2023 and is compatible with Windows 10 and 11.
I'm making a video to explain the code on my YouTube channel.
